            <h1>The Family</h1>
            <p>Over time, the Bat-Family has come to represent the evolution of Batman himself — transforming his crusade from a solitary mission of vengeance into a legacy of hope, trust, and mentorship. What began with Robin grew into a network of vigilantes, detectives, and heroes who reflect different aspects of Bruce Wayne’s character: his compassion through Nightwing, intellect through Tim Drake, discipline through Cassandra Cain, and light through Duke Thomas. Together, they balance Batman’s darkness, proving that his true power lies not in fear, but in the family he inspired — a testament that even in Gotham’s shadows, no one has to fight alone.</p>
