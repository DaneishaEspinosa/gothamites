<h2>Bruce wayne</h2>
<p>Bruce Wayne (Batman) &ndash; First appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Bruce Wayne is Gotham City&rsquo;s billionaire playboy, philanthropist, and heir to the Wayne family fortune. Orphaned at a young age after the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, Bruce dedicated his life to combating crime and preventing similar tragedies. As Batman, he operates as a nocturnal vigilante, using peak human conditioning, advanced martial arts, detective skills, and cutting-edge technology to combat Gotham&rsquo;s criminal underworld. His dual identity allows him to navigate both high society and the criminal element, blending charm and influence as Bruce Wayne with relentless focus and strategic planning as Batman. His relationships are defined by mentorship, camaraderie, and emotional complexity, including prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in the Bat-Family and romantic connections with figures like Selina Kyle, Talia al Ghul, and Zatanna. Batman maintains a strict moral code, refusing to kill while pursuing justice, making him both feared by criminals and a symbol of hope for Gotham&rsquo;s citizens.</p>
